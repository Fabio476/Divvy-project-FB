# Divy-project
This project served as the capstone project for the Google Data Analyst Certification program. Within this project, I aim to showcase a comprehensive set of skills encompassing data cleaning and preprocessing, data exploration and visualization, data analysis and interpretation, and reporting and data storytelling.

This repository has 2 parts:
R code: This file contains the codes used to analyze and create the visualization with comments on the entire process.
Presentation: The presentation includes the visuals that were made using the R code. I explored and explain the findings of the analysis and provided possible solutions to the objective of the shareholder. 

## Scenario
You are a junior data analyst in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.
